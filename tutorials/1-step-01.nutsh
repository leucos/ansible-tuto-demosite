"`INVENTORY`"

"Before continuing, you need an inventory file. The default place for such a file is `/etc/ansible/hosts`."
"However, you can configure ansible to look somewhere else, use an environment variable (`ANSIBLE_HOSTS`), or use the `-i` flag in ansible commands an provide the inventory path."

"Please press the \"`Enter`\" key to continue!"
prompt {
    if command == "" {
        expect(" ")
        break
    }
}

run(`cp /tutorials/files/step-1-2/hosts hosts`)

"I've created an inventory file for you in the workspace named `hosts`"

"Please run *cat hosts* to see the content of your first inventory file"

prompt {
    if success && command =~ "^cat hosts" {
        expect ("cat hosts")
        "`ansible_host` is a special `variable` that sets the IP ansible will use when trying to connect to this host."

        "`ansible_user` is another special `variable` that tells ansible to connect as this user when using ssh. By default ansible would use your current username, or use another default provided in ~/.ansible.cfg (`remote_user`)."
        break

}

"`TESTING`"

"Now that ansible is installed, let's check everything works properly."

"What ansible will try to do here is just executing the ping module (more on modules later) on each host."

"Please run *ansible -m ping all -i hosts*"

prompt {
    if success && command =~ `^ansible -m ping all -i hosts` {
        expect ("ansible -m ping all -i hosts")
        "Good! All 3 hosts are alive and kicking, and ansible can talk to them."
        break
    }
